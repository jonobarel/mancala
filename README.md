# mancala
Jono's Mancala Library

Instructions:

test.py plays the game.

Change line 4 (initialising the Mancala object) to:
    m = mancala.Mancala("Human", "CPU", random_start_player=True)

in order to randomize the starting player.

Alternately, you can change the names and modify line 5 to Mancala.PLAYER1 in order to make the CPU the first player (just don't forget to change the names!)
